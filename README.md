# DSA
🚀 DSA Playground | Mastering Algorithms, One Problem at a Time  🔍 A curated repository of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms solutions, practice problems, and study notes. From arrays to graphs and greedy algorithms to dynamic programming, this repo is my journey to sharpen problem-solving skills and ace technical interviews.  
Features:
✅ Code Snippets in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript
✅ Detailed Explanations for LeetCode, Codeforces, and GfG problems
✅ Topic-wise Breakdown (Arrays, Trees, DP, Graphs, etc.)
✅ Competitive Programming contest solutions and templates
✅ Optimization Techniques (time/space complexity analysis)
